All the Non-hacked clients for Eaglercraft 1.5.2 ( I don’t know all of the websites of eaglercraft 1.5.2 but i know many of them)

https://burritoedition.github.io/emu/Minecraft/web/index.html
https://webclient.asspixel.net/ <-- This has like 4 types of versions (1.3, 1.5.2, 1.8 resent, 1.8.9 EaglercraftX and all are non-hacked clients ) Sadly it’s blocked for me.
https://resent-flax.vercel.app/# <-- Damn!! Guys i found something similar or maybe same as this one last year like november 2022 and that website development was stopped but finally i found this 2 days ago. (what is so special about it? So it has 20+ texture packs and that is the best part for eaglercraft 1.5.2 version). Oldest version of resent client. 

Precision Client (1.5.2-beta_0.2) 
https://sd592g.github.io/zj684od4lfg/
https://sites.google.com/site/classroom6x/minecraft-1-5-2

Precision Client (1.5.2-beta_0.2)  <-- I thought this was taken down but wow it’s still working. Blocked for me sadly.



Eaglercraft 1.5.2 hacked client (well some are very very old but i guess they still works)

Eaglercraft 1.8 Non-hacked clients. (Google drive download files are better and less laggy) also guys i couldn't find more links of eaglercraft 1.8 because many of them are down.

https://eaglercraftx.pages.dev/ 
https://webclient.asspixel.net/
https://eaglercraft.q13x.com/
https://reslauncher.vercel.app/1.8/beta.html
https://reslauncher.vercel.app/1.8/index.html <-- This is the older version of 1.8 resent. 
https://eaglercraft-archive.github.io/Koneclient-1.8-web/ <-- R.I.P to Kone client (server of kone client is down from many months and will never wake up but the)



Eaglercraft 1.3 google drive download file (this is the first version of eaglercraft, no one plays it and i guess there are no servers for it but definitely good starting)

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CAfhYo4dWbEpAQxbVhKa-zYktZUKVNkp/view?usp=sharing <-- This is maybe the only download file for eaglercraft 1.3 




Eaglercraft 1.5.2 download file (definitely this will be less laggy then normal links and also this one are 99% that school can’t block them and all you have to do is just download file and click it twice to open the eaglercraft and make sure to save your file somewhere were school can’t find it).  {note: all files are google drive download file not github}

https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Cn3fI6X4Au_GF7vpotk1fGnfPaVcf5U/view?usp=sharing <-- This is a normal eaglercraft 1.5.2 download file. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1huJatx8BYObcC4KrWAQSsBEPcbCxQUyD/view?usp=sharing <-- This is also just normal eaglercraft 1.5.2 google drive download file.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cfZqhQGOW6abDYppae_NTBlxIh8Lt69l/view?usp=sharing <--  This is a very high level hack client for eaglercraft 1.5.2 and its download file. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/152IJdm6mc7wgDmEyzJ7cGF_NnHaWTT0b/view?usp=sharing <-- This is just a normal hack client for eaglercraft 1.5.2 and its a file.

Eaglercraft 1.8.8 google drive download file (so this one is much better than 1.5.2 in fps but 1.8 doesn’t have single player so both versions are great in their own ways). Resent client has shaders and the shadow client has very good options to boost fps).

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJUfMBwGQOSC25stHCCQgaz6TYr0DnIC/view?usp=sharing <-- First hack client of eaglercraft 1.8, I recommend using dragonX v3 (version 3) because it has very better hacks and less laggy compared to v1.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WE6FLAVb-QQWBsLIHcgeuSarE4ZJzL_w/view?usp=sharing <-- This is the second version of DragonX client and this is also very good but V3 is better for more hacks.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MwZZj6fCiT4bTnAt_JQ-3a5By0jIBW2-/view?usp=sharing <-- This is V3 of the DragonX client. This is one of the best hack clients for eaglercraft 1.8 so if you want to use hacks then definitely use this one. (IDK why but dragonX V3’s loading screen is just classic not like V2 and home page).
https://drive.google.com/file/d/13OXk-48XstlnKKBibWBY8k1YL4IymAhK/view?usp=sharing <-- This is the first eaglercraft 1.8 with shaders, well now many clients have shaders like resent…, but this client is still very good but just so laggy when shaders are on. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5JswNH9rrpIdHW771iOoyugcX66VquK/view?usp=sharing <-- This is the latest version of eaglercraft 1.8 and is less laggy and has many bug fixes and more blocks and stuff like that.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzVxzyJc79ib2nKCJ2Q9jbqrZjBBhef4/view?usp=sharing <-- Kone client used to be very famous client and it also had its own server but the server is down from many months sadly.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EsgVRQ1OV_RsFHepcQZ-YV52B3JKBmKx/view?usp=sharing <--  This is just a normal download file of eaglercraft 1.8. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDSEMmTUJaEtwIe6tQETJ1c1kngW_qRU/view?usp=sharing <-- Pi client is also a hack client for 1.8 and it is kind of good. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c5NYhmH8xgyYKmCULDflg0DMZoiU6Xw4/view?usp=sharing <-- This is my most favourite client, well this is an older version of a resent client but this still works very fine. (I used this for about a whole year and then started using the new one because the new one has shaders and better things).
https://drive.google.com/file/d/19NCp5dt2MEdImnIWf2BX0QUt6OwWCOok/view?usp=sharing <-- This is the latest version of Resent client right now and this is one of the best non-hack clients to use and also this has options to increase fps ingame. (you have to press “right shift button” when you are in a server to open the option bar and also “0” key works too)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/19AHmyx7fuK2eGgu0QsFvZaboAIZSt6dV/view?usp=sharing <-- This is a very very great client (shadow client), so if you are getting low fps in your chromebook and you want high fps then definitely use this client. This has so many options in video settings to improve fps. Also this is an older version of shadow client so the newer version has more options to improve fps.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s--IsWRUej7xNCFiOKSR0OA175bjoRIL/view?usp=sharing <--  This is the newest version of shadow client and this has so many more options in video settings compared to older versions of this client. So if you are getting less than 50 fps then definitely use this client to boost fps for 1.8 version.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_eIeX5pLVLGeJMUVdBK7v7_iK97Io5no/view?usp=sharing <--  This is called UwU client, well this hack client was made by the same owner of RESENT CLIENT. He said he will never make any hacked client but he did lol, well this is also a nice hack client but it's a bit more laggy.



How to get skins for both eaglercraft 1.5.2 and 1.8 (If those links are blocked for you then i will put some download skins down below)  

https://minecraft-max.net 
https://namemc.com/profile/YesSmartyPie.1
https://misterlauncher.org/en/

Resource packs for Eaglercraft 1.8 (once again if the website is blocked for you like it’s blocked for me then i will put some resource packs down below).

https://www.curseforge.com/Minecraft/texture-packs
(this is the only one i use and I don’t have any other)

These are some texture packs if website is blocked for you: 
(you can still use higher versions of resource packs like 1.10, 1.11 and that’s fine because most of the blocks are going to be similar, just don’t use after 1.12 because the texture of swords changs in 1.12).
